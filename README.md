## Can I Leave Melbourne?

> A really dumb creation by [Terence Huynh](https://terencehuynh.com) because of
> Lockdown 2.0

The name is pretty self-explanatory. But hey, if you wanted to check out the
source code of the dumb creation I made, I guess here you go.

---

### What this site is not:

- **Official government advice**: Visit the
  [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/coronavirus)
  for the latest information about COVID-19 in Victoria.

- **Legal advice**: I am not a layer. If you find yourself in trouble, this
  website is not the same as asking a lawyer or getting legal advice from legal
  aid. This is just a dumb website.

- **The best example of my work**: Oh hello, person who might be looking at my
  GitHub and potentially deciding if I should join your company or not. The code
  in this repository will be messy - like really messy and bad practices. Bad
  commit messages. Committing straight to the main branch. And all the fun jazz
  that you probably don't like. Don't take this repo as a reflection of what I
  actually do on a production code base.

### Getting Started

This app uses Next.js and TypeScript. To download all the dependencies and
immediately get started running this site in _development mode_, run the
following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# If you like yarn instead of npm
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Contributing

Feel free to raise issues and pull requests on the repository. I will try and
respond to them as best as I can.

_Note: if there's a Hacktoberfest event on and you're looking for some easy
wins, feel free to use this repo as one of your repos you've contributed to._
